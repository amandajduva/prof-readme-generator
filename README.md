I recieved starter code for this application from this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/potential-enigma.git). I received support from an askBCS Learning Assitant with debugging my code from using fs.writeFile to fs.writeFileSync. I also received support from a tutor, where she explained the expected functionality of the generator and answered questions that I had.
